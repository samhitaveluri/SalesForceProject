# EduConsultPro - Salesforce CRM Setup

This document outlines the setup process for the EduConsultPro Salesforce CRM solution.

## Object Creation

### Importing Objects from Spreadsheets

* **Course Object:**  A custom object named "Course" was created using the data provided in the 'Course' spreadsheet. Spreadsheet columns were mapped to corresponding Salesforce fields in the `Course` object.

* **Remaining Objects:**  Similar to the `Course` object, custom objects were created for `Consultant`, `Student`, `Appointment`, and `Registration` using their respective spreadsheets.  Careful field mapping ensured data integrity during the import process.
